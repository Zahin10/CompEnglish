                <h2>The Pressure to Perform</h2>
                
                <p>When I was a sophomore, I was ‚Äúforced‚Äù into taking hard classes. When in reality I was just trying to prove a point to everyone I am as smart as you and can take classes not many can. This mindset where I needed other approvals took a toll on me. Making that critical decision was far beyond anything I could've prepared for but looking back on it, I do not regret what I learned from it.</p>

                <p>After all that pain of taking multiple classes where I knew I could not carry on the stress of difficult lessons, it set a whole mindset for my future career. Ever since, I started taking classes where I was comfortable and leading my path based upon my strengths and not the beliefs of my classmates and my friends. It is not their fault for encouraging me but my fault for falling into their encouragement when deep down I knew I would be stressed. I wanted to feel proud at the end of sophomore year that I managed to finish my courses, but I knew I could have had a better high school life if I stuck to my beliefs.¬†</p>
                
                <h3>The Lesson</h3>
                
                <p>This experience crystallized a fundamental truth about adversity: while I wouldn't wish this painful period on anyone, the character development it triggered was transformative. This development could‚Äôve been learned later on, but again, going through failures as a child, such as in elementary or middle school, would have made my mind more mature and made me more independent. I am thankful it did happen, but if I were to pass all these classes with stellar grades, there is a chance I would‚Äôve been even happier than I am today. I do not want to live in the past and think about how I messed up my life; instead, I shifted my trajectory into something maybe greater. It's not that my choices weren't right‚Äîsometimes they just weren't right now.
